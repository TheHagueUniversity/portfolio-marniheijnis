    <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-black"><b>About me</b></h1>
    <hr class="w3-round round">
      <p>I'm a 21 year old student who loves designing, enjoying chinese food and exploring with friends. My goal is to create beautiful aesthetics but also user friendly design. Users shouldn't be struggling anymore using applications. As a UXD student I'm learning so much about designing, the impact of design and how to do research for user friendly designs. I think it is a continously growing process, designs and experiences can always be improved. 
      Currently I'm living in Leiden and studying in the Hague, both cities lay in the working heart of the Netherlands. So, close to the big cities such as Amsterdam and Rotterdam.</p>
<h3> My soft skills</h3>
<p>Communicative, problem-solving and hard-working are my soft skills. I'm very communicative because I have been raised in two different cultures. My Dutch culture and my Indonesian culture, my father is Dutch and my mother is Indonesian. Dutch people are direct and hard-working, while Indonesian people are kind and value interpersonal relationships. </p>
      <h3>My hard skills</h3>
      <p>I'm bilingual, my native language is Dutch but I have followed bilingual education and learned to speak English too fluently. Also, I can speak some Chinese and Spanish. Furthermore, I have some experience creating designs using Figma, Adobe XD, HTML5 and CSS.</p>
