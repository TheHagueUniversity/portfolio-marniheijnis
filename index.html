    <hr class="w3-round round">
      <p>I'm a 21 year old UXD student who loves designing, enjoying chinese food and travelling. My goal is to create beautiful designs but also user friendly designs. Users shouldn't be struggling anymore using applications or designs. As a UXD student I'm learning how to do research for design, the values of design and how to work in an international setting. I think the experience of a user is continously changing, so designs and experiences can always be improved and changed.
          Currently I'm living in Leiden in a studenthouse together with my roommates. However, I'm studying in the Hague but both cities are located in the working heart of the Netherlands.</p> <p>Furthermore, I consider myself a really open and kind-hearted person, I love spending time with my family and friends. In my spare time I like to go to the gym or to run in the park. By the way, my favorite color is purple, as you perhaps already have noticed.</p>

<h3> My soft skills</h3>
<p>Communicative, problem-solving and hard-working are my soft skills. I'm very communicative because I have been raised in two different cultures. My Dutch culture and my Indonesian culture, my father is Dutch and my mother is Indonesian. Dutch people are direct and hard-working, while Indonesian people are kind and value interpersonal relationships. </p>
<h3>My hard skills</h3>
<p>I'm bilingual, my native language is Dutch but because I have followed bilingual education, I learned to speak English fluently. Also, I can speak some Chinese and Spanish. Furthermore, I have some experience creating designs using Figma, Adobe XD, Processing, HTML5 and CSS.</p>

    <h2><i>Restaurant Humphrey's Arnhem</i></h2>
      <p><b>Augustus 2017- May 2018</b></p>
        <p>I worked as a waitress to learn communicative and hard working skills. Working in a restaurant is in the beginning very challenging because you have to think about so many things. Also, you always have to stay friendly to your guests in chaotic times. </p>
      <h2><i>Decathlon Arnhem</i></h2>
      <p><b>May 2016- March 2017</b></p>
      <p>I worked at the customer service and I was a cashier. This international company has learned me a lot about team-work and building a huge company from scratch. Decathlon just opened their doors in the city Arnhem, when I started working there. We had to start working at different locations until the building was finished.</p>
      <h2><i>Volunteer work</i></h2>
      <p><b>2013- 2019</b></p>
      <p>For the past couple of years I have done multiple volunteer work. During high school I started volunteering at a retirement home and at my hockey club. Later I volunteered at an organization called Bangsa Dunia (means "people of the world" in Indonesian) who organizes activities for elderly Indonesian people. My mom is one of the founders of this organization and this inspired me to help too! </p>
